Element 1 - loader page:For Round 1, your first task is to accuratelyrecreate the Loader Page. Your goal is toreplicate the provided snapshot of the loaderpage as precisely as possible. Pay closeattention to the overall design, layout, and visualelements presented in the snapshot.While the design must be highly accurate, youhave the flexibility to use your own choice ofcontent for any text or specific images within theloader. This means you can customize messages,loading indicators, or any other dynamic content,as long as the structural and aesthetic integrityof the original design is maintained.Focus on capturing the essence of the loader,including its animations (if any are visible), colorschemes, typography, and positioning ofelements, to ensure a seamless and professionaluser experience.Elements DescriptionElement 2 - image hover:Image Hover EffectFor this element, your task is to implement animage hover effect. When a user hovers theircursor over the specified image (as shown in theprovided video), the image itself should changeits preview. This means the displayed imageshould transform into a different image or adifferent state of the same image upon hover.Crucially, you must pay close attention to thecursor's appearance during this interaction. Thesize and shape of the cursor must remain strictlylimited to what is demonstrated in the video. Donot introduce custom cursor styles or alter thecursor's dimensions beyond what you observe inthe reference. The focus here is on a seamlessand controlled visual change within the image,guided by a standard or minimally alteredcursor.Elements DescriptionElement 3 - image grid:Image Grid with Cursor AnimationsFor this element, you'll be creating an imagegrid. The core requirement here is to implementspecific cursor animations within this grid, asdemonstrated in the provided video.Observe the video closely to understand how thecursor behaves and transforms when interactingwith the images within the grid. This mightinvolve:Custom cursor designs: The cursor might changeits appearance (e.g., shape, color, or icon) whenhovering over different images or areas of thegrid.Interactive effects: The cursor's movement orinteraction might trigger subtle visual effects oranimations on the images themselves (e.g., aripple, highlight, or zoom effect that follows thecursor).Your task is to accurately replicate these cursor-driven animations and interactions within yourimage grid, ensuring they function precisely asshown in the video. Pay attention to the timing,fluidity, and visual style of these animations.Elements DescriptionElement 4 - Navbar:Your next task for Round 1 is to replicate theanimated hamburger navigation bar asaccurately as possible. This means focusingintensely on every detail of its appearance andbehavior.Observe the provided video reference closely forthe following:Initial State: How does the hamburger icon lookwhen the page loads?Animation on Click: What animation occurs whenthe hamburger icon is clicked to open thenavigation menu? Pay attention to thetransformation of the icon itself (e.g., linesrotating, moving), and how the menu appears(e.g., slides in, fades in, expands).Opened State: How does the navigation menulook when it's fully open? Consider its layout,background, and the appearance of thenavigation links.Animation on Close: What animation occurswhen the menu is closed (either by clicking thehamburger again or an"X" icon)?Elements DescriptionElement 5 - page transition:For this element, your task is to accuratelyreproduce the page transition effectdemonstrated in the video. You need to observecarefully how the website visually moves ortransforms from one page to another.Your goal is to replicate this page-to-pagevisual change as precisely as possible, ensuringthe user experience of navigating between pagesmirrors what is shown in the provided video.Elements DescriptionElement 6 - Infinite Marquee:For this element, you are required to implementan infinite marquee effect as demonstrated inthe provided video.Observe the video carefully to understand thefollowing characteristics of the marquee:Your objective is to create a continuouslyscrolling strip of content that perfectly mimicsthe visual flow, speed, and seamless loopingobserved in the reference video.Elements DescriptionElement 7 - team section:For this element, you'll be developing a teamsection that features an interactive hover effect.As shown in the video, you'll present a list ofteam members, likely by their names.The core functionality to replicate is the photopop-up on hover. When a user hovers theircursor over a team member's name, that teammember's photograph should appear or"pop up"directly within or adjacent to their name section.Pay close attention to the following details in thevideo.Elements DescriptionElement 8 - ripple effect:For this element, you are required to implement a ripple effectbased on the demonstration in the provided video.Observe the video closely to understand how this effectmanifests. A ripple effect typically involves a visual animationthat emanates outwards from a point of interaction (like aclick or tap), resembling the ripples created when an object isdropped into water.Pay attention to the following details in the video:Your goal is to accurately recreate this dynamic visualfeedback, ensuring the ripple effect behaves precisely asshown in the reference video, providing a satisfying andintuitive user interaction.Elements DescriptionElement 9 - Text Animation (Scroll-Based Sizing):For this element, you are tasked withimplementing a dynamic text animation thatreacts to user scrolling, as depicted in the video.The core behavior to replicate is:Scrolling Down: As the user scrolls down thepage, the size of the specified text element(s)should progressively increase.Scrolling Up: Conversely, as the user scrolls backup the page, the size of the text element(s)should progressively decrease.Observe the video closely to capture the nuancesof this effectYour objective is to accurately recreate thisinteractive text scaling effect, ensuring itprovides a visually engaging and responsiveexperience as the user scrolls through the page.Elements DescriptionElement 10: The Mystery ElementThe final element for Round 1 is a MysteryElement, offering participants a uniqueopportunity to showcase their creativity andadvanced web development skills.For this element, you are free to implement anyinnovative and impactful web component of yourchoice. There are no specific constraints on whatthis element can be, beyond its integration intothe overall webpage.Consider incorporating:3D elements or animations: Utilize librarieslike Three.js or WebGL to create immersive 3Dexperiences.Interactive data visualizations: Present data ina dynamic and engaging way.Unique cursor interactions: Beyond what'salready requested, explore novel ways thecursor can interact with the page.Generative art or effects: Create elementsthat respond dynamically or are procedurallygenerated.Real-time interactions: Implement featuresthat respond instantly to user input orexternal data.The judging criteria for this element will focus onoriginality, technical complexity, visual appeal,and the seamless integration into your overallwebpage design.
